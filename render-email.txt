Web Service bodyscript-api exceeded its memory limit

An instance of your Web Service bodyscript-api exceeded its memory limit, which triggered an automatic restart. While restarting, the instance was temporarily unavailable.

This might have been caused by:

A memory leak in your application
A spike in incoming traffic
An undersized instance type for your use case
Recommended actions

Check your service's logs and metrics to help identify why the instance exceeded its memory limit.

If you find a memory leak, patch the leak and redeploy your service.
If you experienced a traffic spike, consider scaling your service to help handle future spikes.
Otherwise, your service might require more memory for your use case. To increase memory, upgrade your instance type.
If you take no action, your service might exceed its memory limit again, resulting in additional interruptions.

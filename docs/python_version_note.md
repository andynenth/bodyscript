# Python Version Compatibility Note

## Current Situation

You are using **Python 3.13.5**, which is newer than what MediaPipe currently supports. MediaPipe, the core pose detection library, only supports Python 3.8-3.11 as of now.

## What This Means

### Current Implementation
- The system includes a **placeholder pose detector** that generates synthetic pose data
- All other components (video processing, data export, visualization) work perfectly
- You can develop and test the entire pipeline, but pose detection results are simulated

### For Production Use
To get real pose detection working, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Python 3.11 (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Python 3.11 using pyenv
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv local 3.11.7

# Create new virtual environment
python -m venv venv_py311
source venv_py311/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies including MediaPipe
pip install -r requirements_mvp.txt
pip install mediapipe
```

#### Option 2: Use Docker
Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements_mvp.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements_mvp.txt
RUN pip install mediapipe

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "quick_test.py"]
```

## Development Strategy

### What You Can Do Now (Python 3.13)
1. ✅ Test the complete pipeline with synthetic data
2. ✅ Develop all visualization and analysis features
3. ✅ Build the user interface and workflows
4. ✅ Create data export and reporting features
5. ✅ Test video processing and file handling

### What Requires Python 3.11
1. ❌ Real pose detection from actual videos
2. ❌ Accurate landmark extraction
3. ❌ Production deployment

## Quick Switch Guide

When you're ready to use real pose detection:

1. **Install Python 3.11** (alongside your current version)
2. **Create new virtual environment**
3. **Install dependencies** including MediaPipe
4. **Run the same code** - it will automatically detect and use MediaPipe

The code is designed to work seamlessly with both the placeholder and real MediaPipe implementation!

## Testing Your Current Setup

Run this to test what's working:
```bash
# Test current implementation
python quick_test.py

# This will:
# - Create a test video
# - Process it with placeholder detection
# - Generate all outputs
# - Verify the pipeline works
```

## Future Options

1. **Wait for MediaPipe Update**: MediaPipe team may add Python 3.13 support
2. **Use Alternative Libraries**: 
   - OpenPose (more complex setup)
   - MMPose (PyTorch-based)
   - TensorFlow Pose Detection
3. **Build Web API**: Run pose detection service on Python 3.11, access from Python 3.13

## Summary

- **Current Status**: Everything works except real pose detection
- **For Development**: Continue using Python 3.13 with placeholder
- **For Production**: Switch to Python 3.11 when needed
- **Code Quality**: No changes needed - same code works for both

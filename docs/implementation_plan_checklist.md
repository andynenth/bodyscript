## 📝 Notes Section

### Lessons Learned
- MediaPipe requires Python 3.8-3.11, not compatible with Python 3.13
- Successfully set up dual environment: Python 3.13 for development, Python 3.11 for MediaPipe
- Modular architecture allows easy switching between placeholder and real pose detection
- All components work seamlessly with both synthetic and real pose data

### Technical Challenges
- Initial Python 3.13 incompatibility with MediaPipe
- Resolved by creating separate Python 3.11 virtual environment (venv_py311)
- pyenv makes managing multiple Python versions straightforward

### Performance Observations
- Processing speed: ~57 fps on test video (exceeds target of 30 fps)
- Memory usage: Well under 2GB limit
- MediaPipe initialization shows GL warnings but works correctly
- Detection rate depends heavily on video quality and subject visibility

### Phase 2 Completion Notes (2025-09-17)
- ✅ Successfully implemented all Research System features
- ✅ Created 7 new research modules in /research/ directory:
  - holistic_detector.py - 543 landmark detection (body+hands+face)
  - quality_control.py - Filtering, smoothing, interpolation
  - analytics.py - Joint angles, movement patterns, symmetry
  - visualizations.py - Trajectories, heatmaps, 3D poses
  - reporting.py - HTML reports with embedded visualizations
  - batch_processor.py - Parallel processing for multiple videos
  - research_pose_analyzer.py - Main integration script
- ✅ System can process research-grade analysis with:
  - Holistic detection (543 landmarks)
  - Quality assessment and filtering
  - Joint angle calculations
  - Movement pattern detection (walking, squats, reaching)
  - Professional visualizations
  - Automated HTML reporting
  - Batch processing with comparative analysis

### Future Improvements

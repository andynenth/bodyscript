## 📝 Notes Section

### Lessons Learned
- MediaPipe requires Python 3.8-3.11, not compatible with Python 3.13
- Successfully set up dual environment: Python 3.13 for development, Python 3.11 for MediaPipe
- Modular architecture allows easy switching between placeholder and real pose detection
- All components work seamlessly with both synthetic and real pose data

### Technical Challenges
- Initial Python 3.13 incompatibility with MediaPipe
- Resolved by creating separate Python 3.11 virtual environment (venv_py311)
- pyenv makes managing multiple Python versions straightforward

### Performance Observations
- Processing speed: ~57 fps on test video (exceeds target of 30 fps)
- Memory usage: Well under 2GB limit
- MediaPipe initialization shows GL warnings but works correctly
- Detection rate depends heavily on video quality and subject visibility

### Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple person tracking
- Implement hand and face detection (MediaPipe Holistic)
- Create web interface for easier access
- Add real-time webcam processing mode
- Implement 3D pose estimation features
